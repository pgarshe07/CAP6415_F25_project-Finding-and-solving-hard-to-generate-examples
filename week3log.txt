Repository Organization
- Maintained repository structure:
  - Ensured baseline_generation.ipynb is properly organized
  - Verified results/ and logs/ directories are set up correctly
  - Confirmed .gitignore excludes appropriate files
  - Validated that essential code and documentation are tracked

Challenges Encountered
- Environment setup considerations:
  - SDXL model requires significant disk space (~6.9GB)
  - GPU availability affects generation speed (CPU mode is much slower)
  - Memory requirements need to be considered for batch generation
  - Documented these considerations for future reference

- Generation execution:
  - Long generation times per image (especially on CPU)
  - Need for systematic approach to batch generation
  - Planning for efficient evaluation of generated images

Technical Notes
- SDXL model: ~6.9GB download, requires GPU with 10GB+ VRAM for efficient operation
- Average generation time: ~12-18 seconds per image on GPU, ~5-10 minutes on CPU
- Current prompt collection: 23 variations covering various speed bump scenarios
- Configuration: guidance_scale=7.5, num_inference_steps=50, output size 1024x1024
- Seed management: Using varying seeds for diversity, fixed seeds for reproducibility

Progress Assessment
- Successfully verified baseline generation pipeline is functional
- Confirmed notebook executes correctly in clean environment
- Validated reproducibility of setup and execution
- Maintained focus on documentation quality
- Prepared groundwork for evaluation and fine-tuning in subsequent weeks

Current Status
- Baseline generation notebook is complete and functional
- All 23 prompt variations are configured and ready for use
- Generation pipeline is tested and verified
- Documentation is comprehensive and complete
- Ready to proceed with image generation and evaluation in Week 4

Next Steps for Week 4
- Execute full batch generation:
  * Run baseline notebook to generate 100-200+ baseline images
  * Organize outputs in results/baseline/ directory
  * Create generation logs tracking all runs

- Implement evaluation pipeline:

  * Develop systematic failure case categorization
  * Generate quantitative evaluation reports

- Begin fine-tuning preparation:
  * Set up training infrastructure (DreamBooth or LoRA)
  * Prepare training data from reference images
  * Plan initial fine-tuning experiments

- Conduct comprehensive analysis:
  * Review generated images for quality assessment
  * Identify common failure patterns
  * Document findings and improvement opportunities
  * Prepare preliminary results for Week 4 entry
